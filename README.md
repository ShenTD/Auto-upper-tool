This is an automatic title case assistant tool. 

Click 'Start' to automatically capitalize the first letter of each paragraph, and click 'Pause' to pause the operation.

It has two modes: one detects the capitalization of the first letter of each sentence, and the other detects spaces to capitalize the next letter.
